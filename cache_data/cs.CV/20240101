As a side\neffect, these methods inadvertently restrict the self-attention mechanisms to a\nOne-to-One scheme accessing only a limited subset of LF data, explicitly\npreventing comprehensive optimization on all spatial and angular cues. In this\npaper, we identify this limitation as subspace isolation and introduce a novel\nMany-to-Many Transformer (M2MT) to address it. M2MT aggregates angular\ninformation in the spatial subspace before performing the self-attention\nmechanism. It enables complete access to all information across all\nsub-aperture images (SAIs) in a light field image. Consequently, M2MT is\nenabled to comprehensively capture long-range correlation dependencies. With\nM2MT as the pivotal component, we develop a simple yet effective M2MT network\nfor LFSR. Our experimental results demonstrate that M2MT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across various public datasets.

As such, the same budget of time allows for\nmore RANSAC iterations and therefore additional robustness and a significant\nspeedup. In addition, the paper proposed a Nested RANSAC approach that also\nspeeds up the process, as shown through experiments on TUM, ICL-NUIM, and RGBD\nScenes v2 datasets.", "published": "2024-01-01", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00639v1"}
{"title": "ScatterFormer: Efficient Voxel Transformer with Scattered Linear Attention", "author": "Chenhang He, Ruihuang Li, Guowen Zhang, Lei Zhang", "abstract": "Window-based transformers have demonstrated strong ability in large-scale\npoint cloud understanding by capturing context-aware representations with\naffordable attention computation in a more localized manner. However, because\nof the sparse nature of point clouds, the number of voxels per window varies\nsignificantly. Current methods partition the voxels in each window into\nmultiple subsets of equal size, which cost expensive overhead in sorting and\npadding the voxels, making them run slower than sparse convolution based\nmethods. In this paper, we present ScatterFormer, which, for the first time to\nour best knowledge, could directly perform attention on voxel sets with\nvariable length. The key of ScatterFormer lies in the innovative Scatter Linear\nAttention (SLA) module, which leverages the linear attention mechanism to\nprocess in parallel all voxels scattered in different windows. Harnessing the\nhierarchical computation units of the GPU and matrix blocking algorithm, we\nreduce the latency of the proposed SLA module to less than 1 ms on moderate\nGPUs. Besides, we develop a cross-window interaction module to simultaneously\nenhance the local representation and allow the information flow across windows,\neliminating the need for window shifting. Our proposed ScatterFormer\ndemonstrates 73 mAP (L2) on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset and 70.5 NDS on\nthe NuScenes dataset, running at an outstanding detection rate of 28 FPS.

{"title": "Towards Improved Proxy-based Deep Metric Learning via Data-Augmented Domain Adaptation", "author": "Li Ren, Chen Chen, Liqiang Wang, Kien Hua", "abstract": "Deep Metric Learning (DML) plays an important role in modern computer vision\nresearch, where we learn a distance metric for a set of image representations.\nRecent DML techniques utilize the proxy to interact with the corresponding\nimage samples in the embedding space. However, existing proxy-based DML methods\nfocus on learning individual proxy-to-sample distance while the overall\ndistribution of samples and proxies lacks attention. In this paper, we present\na novel proxy-based DML framework that focuses on aligning the sample and proxy\ndistributions to improve the efficiency of proxy-based DML losses.\nSpecifically, we propose the Data-Augmented Domain Adaptation (DADA) method to\nadapt the domain gap between the group of samples and proxies. To the best of\nour knowledge, we are the first to leverage domain adaptation to boost the\nperformance of proxy-based DML. We show that our method can be easily plugged\ninto existing proxy-based DML losses. Our experiments on benchmarks, including\nthe popular CUB-200-2011, CARS196, Stanford Online Products, and In-Shop\nClothes Retrieval, show that our learning algorithm significantly improves the\nexisting proxy losses and achieves superior results compared to the existing\nmethods.", "published": "2024-01-01", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00617v1"}
{"title": "GD^2-NeRF: Generative Detail Compensation via GAN and Diffusion for One-shot Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields", "author": "Xiao Pan, Zongxin Yang, Shuai Bai, Yi Yang", "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on the One-shot Novel View Synthesis (O-NVS) task\nwhich targets synthesizing photo-realistic novel views given only one reference\nimage per scene. Previous One-shot Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields\n(OG-NeRF) methods solve this task in an inference-time finetuning-free manner,\nyet suffer the blurry issue due to the encoder-only architecture that highly\nrelies on the limited reference image. On the other hand, recent\ndiffusion-based image-to-3d methods show vivid plausible results via distilling\npre-trained 2D diffusion models into a 3D representation, yet require tedious\nper-scene optimization. Targeting these issues, we propose the GD$^2$-NeRF, a\nGenerative Detail compensation framework via GAN and Diffusion that is both\ninference-time finetuning-free and with vivid plausible details. In detail,\nfollowing a coarse-to-fine strategy, GD$^2$-NeRF is mainly composed of a\nOne-stage Parallel Pipeline (OPP) and a 3D-consistent Detail Enhancer\n(Diff3DE). At the coarse stage, OPP first efficiently inserts the GAN model\ninto the existing OG-NeRF pipeline for primarily relieving the blurry issue\nwith in-distribution priors captured from the training dataset, achieving a\ngood balance between sharpness (LPIPS, FID) and fidelity (PSNR, SSIM). Then, at\nthe fine stage, Diff3DE further leverages the pre-trained image diffusion\nmodels to complement rich out-distribution details while maintaining decent 3D\nconsistency. Extensive experiments on both the synthetic and real-world\ndatasets show that GD$^2$-NeRF noticeably improves the details while without\nper-scene finetuning.", "published": "2024-01-01", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00616v2"}
