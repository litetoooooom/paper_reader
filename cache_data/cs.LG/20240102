Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful\nand popular framework for efficient optimization of noisy, black-box objective\nfunctions (e.g., measured property values), thus is a potentially attractive\nframework for MPO. To apply BO to MPO problems, one must select a structured\nmolecular representation that enables construction of a probabilistic surrogate\nmodel. Many molecular representations have been developed, however, they are\nall high-dimensional, which introduces important challenges in the BO process\n-- mainly because the curse of dimensionality makes it difficult to define and\nperform inference over a suitable class of surrogate models. This challenge has\nbeen recently addressed by learning a lower-dimensional encoding of a SMILE or\ngraph representation of a molecule in an unsupervised manner and then\nperforming BO in the encoded space.

Typically, implicit\nfields are encoded by Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) with positional encoding\n(PE) to capture high-frequency geometric details. However, a notable side\neffect of such PE-equipped MLPs is the noisy artifacts present in the learned\nimplicit fields. While increasing the sampling rate could in general mitigate\nthese artifacts, in this paper we aim to explain this adverse phenomenon\nthrough the lens of Fourier analysis. We devise a tool to determine the\nappropriate sampling rate for learning an accurate neural implicit field\nwithout undesirable side effects. Specifically, we propose a simple yet\neffective method to estimate the intrinsic frequency of a given network with\nrandomized weights based on the Fourier analysis of the network's responses. It\nis observed that a PE-equipped MLP has an intrinsic frequency much higher than\nthe highest frequency component in the PE layer. Sampling against this\nintrinsic frequency following the Nyquist-Sannon sampling theorem allows us to\ndetermine an appropriate training sampling rate. We empirically show in the\nsetting of SDF fitting that this recommended sampling rate is sufficient to\nsecure accurate fitting results, while further increasing the sampling rate\nwould not further noticeably reduce the fitting error.
