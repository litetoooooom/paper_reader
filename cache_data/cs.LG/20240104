{"title": "Neural Collapse for Cross-entropy Class-Imbalanced Learning with Unconstrained ReLU Feature Model", "author": "Hien Dang, Tho Tran, Tan Nguyen, Nhat Ho", "abstract": "The current paradigm of training deep neural networks for classification\ntasks includes minimizing the empirical risk that pushes the training loss\nvalue towards zero, even after the training error has been vanished. In this\nterminal phase of training, it has been observed that the last-layer features\ncollapse to their class-means and these class-means converge to the vertices of\na simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF). This phenomenon is termed as Neural\nCollapse (NC). To theoretically understand this phenomenon, recent works employ\na simplified unconstrained feature model to prove that NC emerges at the global\nsolutions of the training problem. However, when the training dataset is\nclass-imbalanced, some NC properties will no longer be true. For example, the\nclass-means geometry will skew away from the simplex ETF when the loss\nconverges. In this paper, we generalize NC to imbalanced regime for\ncross-entropy loss under the unconstrained ReLU feature model. We prove that,\nwhile the within-class features collapse property still holds in this setting,\nthe class-means will converge to a structure consisting of orthogonal vectors\nwith different lengths. Furthermore, we find that the classifier weights are\naligned to the scaled and centered class-means with scaling factors depend on\nthe number of training samples of each class, which generalizes NC in the\nclass-balanced setting. We empirically prove our results through experiments on\npractical architectures and dataset.", "published": "2024-01-04", "categories": ["cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02058v1"}

The self-attention\nmechanism, which is the cornerstone of the high-performance Transformer and\nalso a biologically inspired structure, is absent in existing SNNs. To this\nend, we explore the potential of leveraging both self-attention capability and\nbiological properties of SNNs, and propose a novel Spiking Self-Attention (SSA)\nand Spiking Transformer (Spikformer). The SSA mechanism eliminates the need for\nsoftmax and captures the sparse visual feature employing spike-based Query,\nKey, and Value. This sparse computation without multiplication makes SSA\nefficient and energy-saving. Further, we develop a Spiking Convolutional Stem\n(SCS) with supplementary convolutional layers to enhance the architecture of\nSpikformer. The Spikformer enhanced with the SCS is referred to as Spikformer\nV2. To train larger and deeper Spikformer V2, we introduce a pioneering\nexploration of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) within the SNN. Specifically, we\npre-train Spikformer V2 with masking and reconstruction style inspired by the\nmainstream self-supervised Transformer, and then finetune the Spikformer V2 on\nthe image classification on ImageNet. Extensive experiments show that\nSpikformer V2 outperforms other previous surrogate training and ANN2SNN\nmethods. An 8-layer Spikformer V2 achieves an accuracy of 80.38% using 4 time\nsteps, and after SSL, a 172M 16-layer Spikformer V2 reaches an accuracy of\n81.10% with just 1 time step. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\ntime that the SNN achieves 80+% accuracy on ImageNet.

While\nrecent years have seen a flurry of work on applying various machine learning\ntechniques to the offline optimization problem, the majority of these work\nfocused on learning a surrogate of the unknown objective function and then\napplying existing optimization algorithms. While the idea of modeling the\nunknown objective function is intuitive and appealing, from the learning point\nof view it also makes it very difficult to tune the objective of the learner\naccording to the objective of optimization. Instead of learning and then\noptimizing the unknown objective function, in this paper we take on a less\nintuitive but more direct view that optimization can be thought of as a process\nof sampling from a generative model. To learn an effective generative model\nfrom the offline data examples, we consider the standard technique of\n``re-weighting\", and our main technical contribution is a probably\napproximately correct (PAC) lower bound on the natural optimization objective,\nwhich allows us to jointly learn a weight function and a score-based generative\nmodel.

However, applying these\nmethods to tabular data is challenging due to the less pronounced dependencies\namong data samples. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing\nSwitchTab, a novel self-supervised method specifically designed to capture\nlatent dependencies in tabular data. SwitchTab leverages an asymmetric\nencoder-decoder framework to decouple mutual and salient features among data\npairs, resulting in more representative embeddings. These embeddings, in turn,\ncontribute to better decision boundaries and lead to improved results in\ndownstream tasks. To validate the effectiveness of SwitchTab, we conduct\nextensive experiments across various domains involving tabular data. The\nresults showcase superior performance in end-to-end prediction tasks with\nfine-tuning. Moreover, we demonstrate that pre-trained salient embeddings can\nbe utilized as plug-and-play features to enhance the performance of various\ntraditional classification methods (e.g., Logistic Regression, XGBoost, etc.).\nLastly, we highlight the capability of SwitchTab to create explainable\nrepresentations through visualization of decoupled mutual and salient features\nin the latent space.", "published": "2024-01-04", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02013v1"}

{"title": "Decentralized Multi-Task Online Convex Optimization Under Random Link Failures", "author": "Wenjing Yan, Xuanyu Cao", "abstract": "Decentralized optimization methods often entail information exchange between\nneighbors. Transmission failures can happen due to network congestion,\nhardware/software issues, communication outage, and other factors. In this\npaper, we investigate the random link failure problem in decentralized\nmulti-task online convex optimization, where agents have individual decisions\nthat are coupled with each other via pairwise constraints. Although widely used\nin constrained optimization, conventional saddle-point algorithms are not\ndirectly applicable here because of random packet dropping. To address this\nissue, we develop a robust decentralized saddle-point algorithm against random\nlink failures with heterogeneous probabilities by replacing the missing\ndecisions of neighbors with their latest received values. Then, by judiciously\nbounding the accumulated deviation stemming from this replacement, we first\nestablish that our algorithm achieves $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret and\n$\\mathcal{O}(T^\\frac{3}{4})$ constraint violations for the full information\nscenario, where the complete information on the local cost function is revealed\nto each agent at the end of each time slot. These two bounds match, in order\nsense, the performance bounds of algorithms with perfect communications.\nFurther, we extend our algorithm and analysis to the two-point bandit feedback\nscenario, where only the values of the local cost function at two random points\nare disclosed to each agent sequentially.
