Self-supervised methods hold the\npromise of training directly on real video, but typically perform worse. These\ninclude methods trained with warp error (i.e., color constancy) combined with\nsmoothness terms, and methods that encourage cycle-consistency in the estimates\n(i.e., tracking backwards should yield the opposite trajectory as tracking\nforwards). In this work, we take on the challenge of improving state-of-the-art\nsupervised models with self-supervised training.

Focusing on obtaining a ``clean'' training signal from real-world\nunlabelled video, we propose to separate label-making and training into two\ndistinct stages.

This\nmethodology is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive, but it also has a\nhigh propensity for errors due to factors such as image quality and\nenvironmental conditions, which could potentially lead to incorrect subsequent\nclassifications and misdiagnosis. To address these issues, this paper proposes\nan innovative method of leukocyte detection: the Multi-level Feature Fusion and\nDeformable Self-attention DETR (MFDS-DETR). To tackle the issue of leukocyte\nscale disparity, we designed the High-level Screening-feature Fusion Pyramid\n(HS-FPN), enabling multi-level fusion.

However, the data\nacquired by these sensors are often coarse and noisy, making them impractical\nto use directly. In this paper, we introduce an innovative Depth map denoising\nnetwork (DMDNet) based on the Denoising Implicit Image Function (DIIF) to\nreduce noise and enhance the quality of facial depth images for low-quality 3D\nFR. After generating clean depth faces using DMDNet, we further design a\npowerful recognition network called Lightweight Depth and Normal Fusion network\n(LDNFNet), which incorporates a multi-branch fusion block to learn unique and\ncomplementary features between different modalities such as depth and normal\nimages. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four distinct low-quality\ndatabases demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed methods.\nFurthermore, when combining DMDNet and LDNFNet, we achieve state-of-the-art\nresults on the Lock3DFace database.", "published": "2024-01-01", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00719v1"}
{"title": "Predicting Infant Brain Connectivity with Federated Multi-Trajectory GNNs using Scarce Data", "author": "Michalis Pistos, Islem Rekik", "abstract": "The understanding of the convoluted evolution of infant brain networks during\nthe first postnatal year is pivotal for identifying the dynamics of early brain\nconnectivity development. Existing deep learning solutions suffer from three\nmajor limitations. First, they cannot generalize to multi-trajectory prediction\ntasks, where each graph trajectory corresponds to a particular imaging modality\nor connectivity type (e.g., T1-w MRI). Second, existing models require\nextensive training datasets to achieve satisfactory performance which are often\nchallenging to obtain. Third, they do not efficiently utilize incomplete time\nseries data. To address these limitations, we introduce FedGmTE-Net++, a\nfederated graph-based multi-trajectory evolution network. Using the power of\nfederation, we aggregate local learnings among diverse hospitals with limited\ndatasets. As a result, we enhance the performance of each hospital's local\ngenerative model, while preserving data privacy. The three key innovations of\nFedGmTE-Net++ are: (i) presenting the first federated learning framework\nspecifically designed for brain multi-trajectory evolution prediction in a\ndata-scarce environment, (ii) incorporating an auxiliary regularizer in the\nlocal objective function to exploit all the longitudinal brain connectivity\nwithin the evolution trajectory and maximize data utilization, (iii)\nintroducing a two-step imputation process, comprising a preliminary KNN-based\nprecompletion followed by an imputation refinement step that employs regressors\nto improve similarity scores and refine imputations. Our comprehensive\nexperimental results showed the outperformance of FedGmTE-Net++ in brain\nmulti-trajectory prediction from a single baseline graph in comparison with\nbenchmark methods.", "published": "2024-01-01", "categories": ["q-bio.NC", "cs.AI", "cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01383v1"}

An active research topic under this\nmission is integrating federated learning (FL) with satellite communications\n(SatCom) so that numerous low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites can collaboratively\ntrain a machine learning model. However, the special communication environment\nof SatCom leads to a very slow FL training process up to days and weeks. This\npaper proposes NomaFedHAP, a novel FL-SatCom approach tailored to LEO\nsatellites, that (1) utilizes high-altitude platforms (HAPs) as distributed\nparameter servers (PS) to enhance satellite visibility, and (2) introduces\nnon-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) into LEO to enable fast and\nbandwidth-efficient model transmissions. In addition, NomaFedHAP includes (3) a\nnew communication topology that exploits HAPs to bridge satellites among\ndifferent orbits to mitigate the Doppler shift, and (4) a new FL model\naggregation scheme that optimally balances models between different orbits and\nshells. Moreover, we (5) derive a closed-form expression of the outage\nprobability for satellites in near and far shells, as well as for the entire\nsystem.

{"title": "Data Assimilation in Chaotic Systems Using Deep Reinforcement Learning", "author": "Mohamad Abed El Rahman Hammoud, Naila Raboudi, Edriss S.

A prime example is the widely used ensemble Kalman filter\n(EnKF), which relies on linear updates to minimize variance among the ensemble\nof forecast states. Recent advancements have seen the emergence of deep\nlearning approaches in this domain, primarily within a supervised learning\nframework. However, the adaptability of such models to untrained scenarios\nremains a challenge. In this study, we introduce a novel DA strategy that\nutilizes reinforcement learning (RL) to apply state corrections using full or\npartial observations of the state variables. Our investigation focuses on\ndemonstrating this approach to the chaotic Lorenz '63 system, where the agent's\nobjective is to minimize the root-mean-squared error between the observations\nand corresponding forecast states. Consequently, the agent develops a\ncorrection strategy, enhancing model forecasts based on available system state\nobservations. Our strategy employs a stochastic action policy, enabling a Monte\nCarlo-based DA framework that relies on randomly sampling the policy to\ngenerate an ensemble of assimilated realizations. Results demonstrate that the\ndeveloped RL algorithm performs favorably when compared to the EnKF.\nAdditionally, we illustrate the agent's capability to assimilate non-Gaussian\ndata, addressing a significant limitation of the EnKF.", "published": "2024-01-01", "categories": ["math.DS", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "physics.ao-ph"], "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00916v1"}

In this paper, we consider the DNN service\nproviders share their computing resources as well as their models' parameters\nand allow other DNNs to offload their computations without mirroring. We\npropose a novel algorithm called coordinated DNNs on edge (\\textbf{CoDE}) that\nfacilitates coordination among DNN services by creating multi-task DNNs out of\nindividual models. CoDE aims to find the optimal path that results in the\nlowest possible cost, where the cost reflects the inference delay, model\naccuracy, and local computation workload. With CoDE, DNN models can make new\npaths for inference by using their own or other models' parameters. We then\nevaluate the performance of CoDE through numerical experiments. The results\ndemonstrate a $75\\%$ reduction in the local service computation workload while\ndegrading the accuracy by only $2\\%$ and having the same inference time in a\nbalanced load condition.
