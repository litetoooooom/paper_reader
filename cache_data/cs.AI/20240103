{"title": "On Time-Indexing as Inductive Bias in Deep RL for Sequential Manipulation Tasks", "author": "M. Nomaan Qureshi, Ben Eisner, David Held", "abstract": "While solving complex manipulation tasks, manipulation policies often need to\nlearn a set of diverse skills to accomplish these tasks. The set of skills is\noften quite multimodal - each one may have a quite distinct distribution of\nactions and states. Standard deep policy-learning algorithms often model\npolicies as deep neural networks with a single output head (deterministic or\nstochastic). This structure requires the network to learn to switch between\nmodes internally, which can lead to lower sample efficiency and poor\nperformance. In this paper we explore a simple structure which is conducive to\nskill learning required for so many of the manipulation tasks. Specifically, we\npropose a policy architecture that sequentially executes different action heads\nfor fixed durations, enabling the learning of primitive skills such as reaching\nand grasping. Our empirical evaluation on the Metaworld tasks reveals that this\nsimple structure outperforms standard policy learning methods, highlighting its\npotential for improved skill acquisition.", "published": "2024-01-03", "categories": ["cs.RO", "cs.AI"], "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01993v1"}

Current SSL methods leverage Data-Augmentations\n(DA) for generating positive samples and incorporate prior knowledge - an\nincorrect, or too weak DA will drastically reduce the quality of the learned\nrepresentation. GPS-SSL proposes instead to design a metric space where\nEuclidean distances become a meaningful proxy for semantic relationship. In\nthat space, it is now possible to generate positive samples from nearest\nneighbor sampling. Any prior knowledge can now be embedded into that metric\nspace independently from the employed DA. From its simplicity, GPS-SSL is\napplicable to any SSL method, e.g. SimCLR or BYOL. A key benefit of GPS-SSL is\nin reducing the pressure in tailoring strong DAs. For example GPS-SSL reaches\n85.58% on Cifar10 with weak DA while the baseline only reaches 37.51%. We\ntherefore move a step forward towards the goal of making SSL less reliant on\nDA. We also show that even when using strong DAs, GPS-SSL outperforms the\nbaselines on under-studied domains. We evaluate GPS-SSL along with multiple\nbaseline SSL methods on numerous downstream datasets from different domains\nwhen the models use strong or minimal data augmentations.

Such problems are traditionally modeled as\nnon-stationary Markov decision processes (NSMDP). However, existing approaches\nfor decision-making in NSMDPs have two major shortcomings: first, they assume\nthat the updated environmental dynamics at the current time are known (although\nfuture dynamics can change); and second, planning is largely pessimistic, i.e.,\nthe agent acts ``safely'' to account for the non-stationary evolution of the\nenvironment. We argue that both these assumptions are invalid in practice --\nupdated environmental conditions are rarely known, and as the agent interacts\nwith the environment, it can learn about the updated dynamics and avoid being\npessimistic, at least in states whose dynamics it is confident about. We\npresent a heuristic search algorithm called \\textit{Adaptive Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (ADA-MCTS)} that addresses these challenges.

However, the inherent limitations of traditional neural\nnetworks arise due to their relatively fixed network structures and activation\nfunctions. 1, The type of activation function is single and relatively fixed,\nwhich leads to poor \"unit representation ability\" of the network, and it is\noften used to solve simple problems with very complex networks; 2, the network\nstructure is not adaptive, it is easy to cause network structure redundant or\ninsufficient. To address the aforementioned issues, this study proposes a novel\nneural network called X-Net. By utilizing our designed Alternating\nBackpropagation mechanism, X-Net dynamically selects appropriate activation\nfunctions based on derivative information during training to enhance the\nnetwork's representation capability for specific tasks. Simultaneously, it\naccurately adjusts the network structure at the neuron level to accommodate\ntasks of varying complexities and reduce computational costs. Through a series\nof experiments, we demonstrate the dual advantages of X-Net in terms of\nreducing model size and improving representation power. Specifically, in terms\nof the number of parameters, X-Net is only 3$\\%$ of baselines on average, and\nonly 1.4$\\%$ under some tasks. In terms of representation ability, X-Net can\nachieve an average $R^2$=0.985 on the fitting task by only optimizing the\nactivation function without introducing any parameters. Finally, we also tested\nthe ability of X-Net to help scientific discovery on data from multiple\ndisciplines such as society, energy, environment, and aerospace, and achieved\nconcise and good results.", "published": "2024-01-03", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.NI"], "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01772v1"}

Chklovskii", "abstract": "In the quest to model neuronal function amidst gaps in physiological data, a\npromising strategy is to develop a normative theory that interprets neuronal\nphysiology as optimizing a computational objective. This study extends the\ncurrent normative models, which primarily optimize prediction, by\nconceptualizing neurons as optimal feedback controllers. We posit that neurons,\nespecially those beyond early sensory areas, act as controllers, steering their\nenvironment towards a specific desired state through their output. This\nenvironment comprises both synaptically interlinked neurons and external motor\nsensory feedback loops, enabling neurons to evaluate the effectiveness of their\ncontrol via synaptic feedback. Utilizing the novel Direct Data-Driven Control\n(DD-DC) framework, we model neurons as biologically feasible controllers which\nimplicitly identify loop dynamics, infer latent states and optimize control.\nOur DD-DC neuron model explains various neurophysiological phenomena: the shift\nfrom potentiation to depression in Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP)\nwith its asymmetry, the duration and adaptive nature of feedforward and\nfeedback neuronal filters, the imprecision in spike generation under constant\nstimulation, and the characteristic operational variability and noise in the\nbrain. Our model presents a significant departure from the traditional,\nfeedforward, instant-response McCulloch-Pitts-Rosenblatt neuron, offering a\nnovel and biologically-informed fundamental unit for constructing neural\nnetworks.", "published": "2024-01-03", "categories": ["q-bio.NC", "cs.AI", "cs.SY", "eess.SY"], "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01489v1"}
{"title": "Uncertainty Regularized Evidential Regression", "author": "Kai Ye, Tiejin Chen, Hua Wei, Liang Zhan", "abstract": "The Evidential Regression Network (ERN) represents a novel approach that\nintegrates deep learning with Dempster-Shafer's theory to predict a target and\nquantify the associated uncertainty. Guided by the underlying theory, specific\nactivation functions must be employed to enforce non-negative values, which is\na constraint that compromises model performance by limiting its ability to\nlearn from all samples. This paper provides a theoretical analysis of this\nlimitation and introduces an improvement to overcome it. Initially, we define\nthe region where the models can't effectively learn from the samples. Following\nthis, we thoroughly analyze the ERN and investigate this constraint. Leveraging\nthe insights from our analysis, we address the limitation by introducing a\nnovel regularization term that empowers the ERN to learn from the whole\ntraining set. Our extensive experiments substantiate our theoretical findings\nand demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.", "published": "2024-01-03", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01484v1"}
{"title": "Incorporating Geo-Diverse Knowledge into Prompting for Increased Geographical Robustness in Object Recognition", "author": "Kyle Buettner, Sina Malakouti, Xiang Lorraine Li, Adriana Kovashka", "abstract": "Existing object recognition models have been shown to lack robustness in\ndiverse geographical scenarios due to significant domain shifts in design and\ncontext. Class representations need to be adapted to more accurately reflect an\nobject concept under these shifts. In the absence of training data from target\ngeographies, we hypothesize that geography-specific descriptive knowledge of\nobject categories can be leveraged to enhance robustness. For this purpose, we\nexplore the feasibility of probing a large-language model for\ngeography-specific object knowledge, and we investigate integrating knowledge\nin zero-shot and learnable soft prompting with the CLIP vision-language model.\nIn particular, we propose a geography knowledge regularization method to ensure\nthat soft prompts trained on a source set of geographies generalize to an\nunseen target set of geographies. Our gains on DollarStreet when generalizing\nfrom a model trained only on data from Europe are as large as +2.8 on countries\nfrom Africa, and +4.6 on the hardest classes. We further show competitive\nperformance vs. few-shot target training, and provide insights into how\ndescriptive knowledge captures geographical differences.", "published": "2024-01-03", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01482v1"}
{"title": "Token Propagation Controller for Efficient Vision Transformer", "author": "Wentao Zhu", "abstract": "Vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved promising results on a variety of\nComputer Vision tasks, however their quadratic complexity in the number of\ninput tokens has limited their application specially in resource-constrained\nsettings. Previous approaches that employ gradual token reduction to address\nthis challenge assume that token redundancy in one layer implies redundancy in\nall the following layers. We empirically demonstrate that this assumption is\noften not correct, i.e., tokens that are redundant in one layer can be useful\nin later layers. We employ this key insight to propose a novel token\npropagation controller (TPC) that incorporates two different\ntoken-distributions, i.e., pause probability and restart probability to control\nthe reduction and reuse of tokens respectively, which results in more efficient\ntoken utilization. To improve the estimates of token distributions, we propose\na smoothing mechanism that acts as a regularizer and helps remove noisy\noutliers. Furthermore, to improve the training-stability of our proposed TPC,\nwe introduce a model stabilizer that is able to implicitly encode local image\nstructures and minimize accuracy fluctuations during model training. We present\nextensive experimental results on the ImageNet-1K dataset using DeiT, LV-ViT\nand Swin models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For\nexample, compared to baseline models, our proposed method improves the\ninference speed of the DeiT-S by 250% while increasing the classification\naccuracy by 1.0%.", "published": "2024-01-03", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "cs.MM", "cs.NE"], "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01470v1"}

Shanahan", "abstract": "Summarization of electronic health records (EHRs) can substantially minimize\n'screen time' for both patients as well as medical personnel. In recent years\nsummarization of EHRs have employed machine learning pipelines using state of\nthe art neural models. However, these models have produced less than adequate\nresults that are attributed to the difficulty of obtaining sufficient annotated\ndata for training. Moreover, the requirement to consider the entire content of\nan EHR in summarization has resulted in poor performance due to the fact that\nattention mechanisms in modern large language models (LLMs) adds a quadratic\ncomplexity in terms of the size of the input. We propose here a method that\nmitigates these shortcomings by combining semantic search, retrieval augmented\ngeneration (RAG) and question-answering using the latest LLMs. In our approach\nsummarization is the extraction of answers to specific questions that are\ndeemed important by subject-matter experts (SMEs). Our approach is quite\nefficient; requires minimal to no training; does not suffer from the\n'hallucination' problem of LLMs; and it ensures diversity, since the summary\nwill not have repeated content but diverse answers to specific questions.", "published": "2024-01-03", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01469v1"}
